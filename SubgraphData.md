# PoolTogether V3 Subgraph Introduction

PoolTogether has a GraphQL API Endpoint hosted by [The Graph](https://thegraph.com/docs/about/introduction#what-the-graph-is) called a subgraph for indexing and organizing data from the PoolTogether smart contracts.

This subgraph can be used to query on-chain PoolTogether data. The subgraph data is serviced by a decentralized group of server operators called [Indexers](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/network/indexing/).
